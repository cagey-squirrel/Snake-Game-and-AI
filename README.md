# Snake-Game-and-AI

If you would just like to view how the final product looks like, there is a short video on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgFpfPRWCIA

I made a basic snake game and then used a genetic algorithm NEAT to make an AI which plays this game. This project helped me understand the importance of fitness function in genetic algorithms, number of inputs, outputs, hidden layers and nodes and how to optimize them.
